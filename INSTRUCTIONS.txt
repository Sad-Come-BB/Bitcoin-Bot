I did this very quickly.
If there are bugs, I will send you a patch.

See example Python code in example.py

YOU MUST DO THE FOLLOWING!

You must include trading.py in the same directory as your main program.

IMPORTANT!

My library allows you to bet on the price going up or down, check your account balance, and query which side of the trade you are currently on.
The website also gives you updates on the current prices observed by the website.
However, if you want more complex analysis of price data, it is recommended to use another service (such as Binance).
It is recommended that you gather crypto-related data for analysis from sources of your choosing, e.g. the Binance API.
The sources you choose will of course be based on/influenced by your personal trading strategy.

ANY QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS LET ME KNOW!
